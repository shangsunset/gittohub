# quickhub
Creating github project made easy

Every time you want to start a project, you have to `git init`, create a repo on Github, and type a bunch of commands
to `add remote origin` blah blah.
I cant never remember those commands, so I created quickhub - one simple command, from `git init` to `first commit`.

## Usage

to init git on your local machine, create a repo on Github, and add remote to it: 
```
quickhub awesomeProject
```
